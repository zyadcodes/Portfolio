# ./ Help

## ./ What was it?

Help was a mobile app that I built with some other students in high school that provided an Uber-like experience to small businesses that offered services such as cleaning, plumbing, and landscaping. Customers would go on their app, request a service such as cleaning, schedule it, pay for it, and the business would receive the request and dispatch somebody to copmlete it.

## ./ What technologies did I use?

I built the mobile app using React Native, Node.JS, and the Google Firebase suite for authentication, as well as the document-based Cloud Firestore database. There was also a web app built using React.JS with HTML and CSS. 

## ./ What did I do?

- Mobile app that allowed customers to order services such as landscaping, tutoring, and cleaning services from local businesses that provided them.
- Built & released an MVP of a mobile application using React Native, Node.JS, and Google Firebase suite.
- Put together & led a team of 10 (6 developers and 4 marketers) and delegated tasks to move from idea to vision & communicated that vision with customers.
- Learned a lot about hiring people, product development, ideologies, and hands on experience with various technologies.
