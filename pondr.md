# ./ Pondr

## ./ What was it?

Pondr was a startup that I interned at during the summer of 2021. The startup leveraged Natural Langauge Processing to provide A.I-driven analytics for e-commerce sellers via review analysis. I worked across the project from building out the analytics platform on the front end, to aiding the AI team in building out the API to analyze the data.

## ./ What technologies did I use?

I worked on the frontend of the web app using React.JS and Redux. I worked on the backend as well for a portion of time using Python Flask, Azure, and GPT-3 technology which was a Natural Language Processing model developed by OpenAI.
