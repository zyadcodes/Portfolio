# ./ Coding is Us

## ./ What was it?

Quran Connect was a mobile app that I built alongside some friends to serve as a classroom management solution for Islamic institutions. Religious teachers could use it to keep track of student assignments, manage grades, communicate with the classroosm, and much more. [Check out the code here.](https://github.com/zyadcodes/QConnect)

## ./ What technologies did I use?

I built the mobile app using React Native, AWS Ampliy, Node.JS, and the Google Firebase Suite for authentication, database services, hosting, and Cloud Firestore, which is a document-based NoSQL database that was used to securely store user data.
