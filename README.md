# ./ A little about me

My name is Zyad Elgohary. I'm currently a student at the University of Washington Bothell with a minor in Entrepreneurship. I'm graduating in the Spring of 2023. I've always had an interest in Computer Science. I learned how to code at the beginning of high school and, ever since, I've been building a lot of projects and even started a few startups with some friends involving some apps and websites that I've built. I love sitting down and hacking away at a coding project in my free time while learning new technologies whenever I can. I am currently seeking software engineering internships for summer 2022.

### Pondr

Pondr was a startup that I interned at during the summer of 2021. The startup leveraged Natural Langauge Processing to provide A.I-driven analytics for e-commerce sellers via review analysis. I worked across the project from building out the analytics platform on the front end, to aiding the AI team in building out the API to analyze the data.

### Coding is Us

Coding is Us was a project I worked on during the pandemic which was a code learning platform developed for people around the world. It aggregated resources from across YouTube and organized the best courses by language, technology, etc. It also provided progress tracking and in-site IDE.

### Help

Help was a mobile app that I built with some other students in high school that provided an Uber-like experience to small businesses that offered services such as cleaning, plumbing, and landscaping. Customers would go on their app, request a service such as cleaning, schedule it, pay for it, and the business would receive the request and dispatch somebody to copmlete it.
