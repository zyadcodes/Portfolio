# ./ Coding is Us

## ./ What was it?

Coding is Us was a project I worked on during the pandemic which was a code learning platform developed for people around the world. It aggregated resources from across YouTube and organized the best courses by language, technology, etc. It also provided progress tracking and in-site IDE.

## ./ What technologies did I use?

I built the mobile app using React Native, React.JS, Node.JS, and the Google Firebase Suite for authentication, database services, and hosting. Firebase Cloud Firestore is a document-based database that was used to securely store user data.

## ./ What did I do?

- Platform that aggregated coding resources from across the internet and posted them in an organized fashion for users to be able to learn from and track their learning progress.
- Designed & programmed the mobile app from scratch using React Native & Node.JS and deployed to production-level Android & iOS environments. This was coupled with a React web app to serve as the platformâ€™s website. Grew to over 5,000 active users at its peak using continuous testing techniques.
- Grew a social media following from 0 to thousands of engaged followers using growth tactics and strategic advertising.
